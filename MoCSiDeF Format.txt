#The format for a Monte Carlo Simulation Description File (MoCSiDeF) file (.mocsidef)

#To avoid circular dependancies, variables can only be referenced after they have been defined
#    Therefore, the order of random and calculated variable definition is important
#Empty lines and lines beginning with a '#' are ignored
#There should be no spaces during a variable definition/expression
#    Therefore, when splitting a line by the space character, the variable definition/expression should be the last element
#Variable names can be strings of 1 or more characters (they are allowed to not be a single letter)
#Variable names must only consist of alphabetical characters

#A comment line

#The number of trials that should be run for the simulation. Only one version of this line should exist in the file
trials=128

#A binomially-distributed random variable called X with 20 trials and probability of success of 0.2
random X=B(20,0.2)

#Valid random variables:
#    Range(a,b) -> a uniformly-distributed variable that can take integer values in the range [a,b]
#		a and b must be integers and a must be lesser than or equal to b
#    B(n,p) -> binomially-distributed variable with 'n' trials and 'p' probability of success

#A variable called A which contains double the value of X
var A=2*X

#A variable called B which contains 1 more than the value of A where B should be recorded as a result of the simulation
record var B=A+1

#A variable that uses X, A and B
var C=A*2+B-X

#Valid algebraic operations:
#    + -> addition
#    - -> subtraction
#    * -> multiplication
#    / -> division
#    % -> modulo operator
